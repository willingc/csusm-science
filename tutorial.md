Tutorial: Let's make a blog
===========================

Welcome CSUSM students!

Let's get started making a blog using the Django framework and Python. Over the next
several weeks, we'll be working through a tutorial that San Diego Python User Group
and PyLadies San Diego have developed and used in our local workshop.

.. HINT::
   We'll be working on `Test Driven Development using Django` http://test-driven-django-development.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

I encourage to work at your own pace through the tutorial. Feel free to ask questions
on IRC channel #sandiegopython on Freenode network, email me, or create an issue on
GitHub (which might be best since other members of this group can help too.)
