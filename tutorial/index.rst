Tutorial Guide: Let's make a blog
=================================

Welcome CSUSM WIE students!

Let's get started making a blog using the Django framework and Python. Over the next
several weeks, we'll be working through a tutorial that San Diego Python User Group
and PyLadies San Diego have developed and used in our local workshop.

.. HINT::
   We'll be working on Test Driven Development using Django <http://test-driven-django-development.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>.

I encourage to work at your own pace through the tutorial. Don't worry if
you fall behind; we'll make sure you may catch up if you wish.
It is also fine to work at a faster pace. Since you understand your time
availability better than anyone, you set your individual pace and we will
support you along the way.

The Project: building a blog
----------------------------

The right of passage for most web developers is their own blog system. Our goal is to have a CSUSM WIE blog up and running by March 31, 2015, perhaps sooner.


Getting help
------------
Feel free to ask questions on IRC channel #sandiegopython on Freenode
network, email me, or create an issue on GitHub (which might be best
since other members of this group can help too).
